/*Project 1 - Aloha*/ 

This is a project which tests students abilities relating to HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

This webpage is fully compatable across all browsers and devices.

Some challanges including learning css flexbox and getting the smooth scroll to work correctly in jQuery. At the completion of this project, I can say that I learned a great deal about HTML, CSS and started to get comfertable with simple Javascript functions.
